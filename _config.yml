            The focus of this project was on the handling of strings in software systems. Existing research relying on regular expressions to study strings often overlooks important features in modern programming languages. This project bridges such a gap by enhancing theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

          This work presents an approach to find a maximum $2$-packing set in a cactus graph. The main result is an algorithm that decomposes the input graph into biconnected components to form a tree, then it solves each component individually and merges partial solutions to find such a set.

          club finding in networks is a fundamental problem graph problem. To overcome the limitations of strict clubs, a relaxed version called $s$-club is studied. The $s$-club allows for greater flexibility in modelling relationships such as social concepts. Finding the largest $s$-club in an arbitrary graph is computationally challenging. Here we propose a dynamic programming algorithm that efficiently solves such a problem on an $n$-vertex tree in $O(s \cdot n)$ time for $s \geq 2$, outperforming existing methods. This advancement paves the way for finding maximum $s$-clubs in less restrictive graphs. We use [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [YAML](https://yaml.org/) and [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) for the project's scripts. We also provide a small set of artificial and real trees (along with corresponding credits) for experimentation.

          This project involves a brief report on regular expressions (regex) within the [NPM package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) for [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/). To extract the data, we developed a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) script called 'RegexFinder.rb'. The input can be either the NPM installation directory or a set of JavaScript files, and the output includes details about regex usage. The information is displayed on the screen and can be saved as markdown or PDF files.
